## Bobby
### Lead Guitar


#### Bronx
  - Outro
    - Might be cool to add a sloppy/squealy guitar lick that loosely follows the rhythm
      - I feel like there's something missing here.

#### Circus
  - Post-Chorus
    - Would be cool to come up with something
  - Outro
    - Find something to add some more intersted; idea TBD

#### Drop Dave
**WIP: These are a few of Dave's ideas the may need some refinement/development**
  - Intro
    - Dave doesn't like his intro lead. Same lead should be rerecorded, but starting from the beginning of the, with the harmonies being introduced halfway through.
  - Bridge
    - Dave wants octaves; I don't think there's space, but a traditional lead line could be cool.

#### Fingerpicking
  - Intro
    - Maybe some sloppy/noisey/feedbacky harmonics and trash for the into (also maybe bridge/just an idea for you to play with)
  - Post-Chorus
    - Dave wants to play with a lead here. This probably comes out of the above for the first repetition
      - @Dave, In the project I have only the initial *fingerpicked* part labelled as intro. Since the next part is also a post-chorus I have used this as my label for all repetitions. Don't care what's right; just want these notes to be consistent when we get back into prod. lmk if you think I've misunderstood your notes.

#### Gospel
- Outro A (The part before the final organ section)
  - Lead?
    - Needs development/refinement

#### I Go Back
- Whole song (outro possibly excluded)
  - Something?
    - Needs development, but maybe a slide or similar?

#### Inverted
- Bridge/Outro
  - Replace the synth with something cool
    - Synth sucks; Must be destroyed.

#### I Don't Have Much Left
- Interlude (The instrumental bit after the intro and its repetitions)
  - To defeat the TMNT we need to call in Shredder!




### Rhythm Guitar
#### I go back
  - Outro Kordz, bruv!
### Backup Vocals

    - 4 Seconds in; 4 seconds out
    - This room spins round; your mouth goes numb  
  - Prechorus

#### Circus
  - Outro
    - Maybe some outro harmonies w/ Mike if you find something cool
#### Drop Dave

    - Backup Woahs in Chorus
  - Misc
    - A few adlib double ideas to add some ear candy
#### Fingerpicking
  - Chorus

#### Gospel
  - Basically everything that was done by Dave/gang vox (I'm still missing, not singling dave out)
  - I don't have ideas, but something in the outro (before the organ enters) would be cool

#### I don't have much left
  - Chorus
    - All of it
  - Verse (I don't remember if this was you or I)
    - If I ewat this chipped tooth like a badge of honor
    - I'm living in the shadow of what I could've been
  - Refrain (harms)
    - I'll grow the moment I stop feeling so old
    - At night I dream of broken bones but settle for a blood nose.
  - Refrain 2 (harms
    - I'll grow the second some new vice takes hold
    - At night I dream of smashing molds, but settle for habits well-worn.

  - Misc experiments/elsewhere.
#### The Gates (Vulgaire Dave)
  - Chorus
    - Wait! Wait!
    - There's something at the gates,
    - You can hear it's heavy breathing
    - as it's clawing at the paint.
    - Too late! Too late!
    - There no keeping it at bay,
    - the door begins to splinter,
    - you can hear it as it sings:
      - Dave's note: i have a suggestion for « the gate’s » chorus! Since the voice overlapping might be problematic, on the first part of the chorus (Bobby and you) we could ask Bobby to do what we were doing before, but also do another track that is more melodic (cuz the first part is really rhythmic)! If it ends up that the overlapping isn’t working, we could do 1: fist part you doing the same as usual and Bobby more melodic, then part 2 just mike and I and we cut Bobby and you! My point is that by asking Bobby to track an extra melodic one on the first part, it gives us more option for mixing! Idk what u think.
        - I think this makes the problem it is trying to solve worse. Repetition legitimizes and in this case we need to validate the strange counterpoint here. Topic for discussion and, time permitting, we can simply do as Dave suggests and try both ways.
#### Tough Tempo
  - Maybe some subtle lines, but to keep it classic, let's keep things simple
